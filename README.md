# üìö E-Book Management Smart Contract

The **E-Book Management Smart Contract** is a decentralized application (dApp) for managing e-book metadata on the blockchain. This platform facilitates secure, transparent, and efficient storage, management, and sharing of e-books. 

The contract provides a range of functionalities, including uploading e-books, transferring ownership, updating metadata, and access control, ensuring proper validation and error handling throughout. 

With its decentralized nature, this contract empowers users with complete control over their e-books while fostering a secure and reliable system for e-book management.

## ‚ú® Features

1. **Upload New E-Books**  
   Users can upload e-books with metadata such as title, file size, summary, and categories.

2. **Retrieve Metadata**  
   Fetch detailed metadata for any e-book by its unique ID.

3. **Ownership Management**  
   Authors can transfer ownership of an e-book to another user securely.

4. **Update Metadata**  
   Authors can modify metadata of their e-books to keep information current.

5. **Access Control**  
   Authors and designated users can manage access to specific e-books.

6. **Error Handling**  
   Standardized error codes ensure seamless error identification and resolution.

## üìú How It Works

### Key Concepts
- **Decentralization**: All data is stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.
- **Ownership**: E-books are tied to the principal ID of their authors. Ownership can be transferred.
- **Validation**: Inputs such as title, file size, and categories are strictly validated to maintain data integrity.
- **Access Rights**: Permissions are managed for users to allow or restrict access to specific e-books.

### Smart Contract Components
- **Constants**: Define system limits (e.g., max title length, max file size) and error codes for consistency.
- **Data Storage**: Utilizes maps to store e-book metadata and user access permissions.
- **Functions**: Public functions enable interaction with the contract, while private functions handle internal operations.

## üìÇ Data Model

### E-Book Metadata
Each e-book's metadata is stored with the following structure:
- **`title`**: ASCII string (max 64 characters)
- **`author`**: Principal ID of the uploader
- **`file-size`**: File size in bytes
- **`upload-time`**: Block height at the time of upload
- **`summary`**: ASCII string summary (max 256 characters)
- **`categories`**: List of ASCII strings (max 8, each 32 characters)

### Access Rights
Access permissions are stored in a map with the structure:
- **`ebook-id`**: E-book's unique ID
- **`user`**: Principal ID of the user
- **`can-access`**: Boolean indicating whether the user has access
